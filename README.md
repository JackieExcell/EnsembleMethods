# An Investigation of Ensemble Methods and Vote Forecasting

This project predicts 2016 U.S. election results by using county level previous election and official demographic data to train models. We compared the results of four widely used mainstream in the field of machine learning and data mining - Random Forests, AdaBoost, k-nearest neighbours (k-NN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Random Forests outperform others. We show that ensemble methods can perform very competitively in multi-attribute involved binary predictions such as presidential election predictions.
